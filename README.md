# clarionCRM
A simple CRM written in python flask to help manage networking opportunites. Starting off small but hoping to add more features.

<h2>Current Features:</h2>

* Adding contact cards
* Updating Comments
* Updating Last Contacted which increases or decreases the relationship level
* Basic Filters to help you sort through the list of contacts
* Changing certain settings (For now it's only maxDays which determines how relationship level is measured)
* Profile Picture Upload

<h2>Planned Features:</h2>

* General Card Color Corrections and Styling
* Scroll Bar that remembers position
* Editing Cards after creation
* More elements that glow (tastefully)
* Database Cleanups
