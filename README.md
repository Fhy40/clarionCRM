# clarionCRM
A simple CRM written in python flask to help manage networking opportunites. Starting off small but hoping to add more features.

Current Features:
* Adding contact cards
* Updating Comments
* Updating Last Contacted which increases or decreases the relationship level
* Basic Filters to help you sort through the list of contacts
* Changing certain settings (For now it's only maxDays which determines how relationship level is measured)
